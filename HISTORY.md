- Converted gulpfile.js to gulpfile.coffee
- _package.json: Replace ~x.y.z with ~x
- Added normalize cdn. 
- Removed extra scss files so there's just main.scss.
- Added Google Font prompt
- Added css defaults, helper functions, components, and bootstrap overrides
- Added bootstrap prompt
- Attach answer.features directly to app instance instead of moving includeBootstrap, includeNormalize etc over manually

## Todo
- Dynamic CDN urls
